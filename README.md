# OpenPRGame
OpenPRGame is an open-source remake of Princess Rush (プリンセスラッシュ).

# What is Princess Rush(プリンセスラッシュ)?
Princess Rush (プリンセスラッシュ), or 검과 공주의 시간 is a Flick-style Anime-ish RPG, where you setup your team and fight with the enemies. You can setup what character should fight and should rest while in battle by flicking the character left (rest) and right (fight).

# Why did I started this project?
This game was **my one of the favorite** game. Unfortunately, the game has stopped supporting the service since January 5, 2017. I had a big nostalgic memories with this game, so I started to make this game as an open-source game and feel the *mighty* gameplay again.



**The content of the bottom is unfinished, and it may be changed in future.**

# What is this made of?
OpenPR is made of LibGDX and Java 8. Supports many resolutions, but in battle the resolution will be scaled down to 9:16 ratio (mobile phone). You can run this on Android, Windows, and Linux (with Java runtime)

# How to play?
