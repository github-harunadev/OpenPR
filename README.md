OpenPRGame is an open-source remake of Princess Rush (プリンセスラッシュ).

# Motivation?
Princess Rush (プリンセスラッシュ), or 검과 공주의 시간 is a Flick-style Anime-ish RPG, where you setup your team and fight with the enemies. You can setup what character should fight and should rest while in battle by flicking the character left (rest) and right (fight).

This game was **my one of the favorite** game. Unfortunately, the game has stopped supporting the service from January 5, 2017. I had a big nostalgic memories with this game, so I started to remake this game as an open-source game and feel the gameplay again.
